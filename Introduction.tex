\section{Overviews}

	\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
	\noindent{
		The overview of this document is to provide the details of requirement for the Tank Farm Inventory(TFI) System. The TFI system can provides real-time and on-line system to detect and manage the volume quantities and mass tonnage of products in tanks at the tank terminal for the whole day.This system can also fill out the tank quantities in term of volume and mass for both static and non-static tank levels.Each tank is equipped with two temperature,density,and level meter gauges.Besides that, TFI system can convert volume of products in tank in liters to mass in kilograms at Terminal service incorporated zone.This system also able to generate either text-based or web-based reports on time and demand basis.Tank Farm Inventory System can stores informations for a minimum period of 5 years.\\}

		\noindent{
		   Furthermore, The tank farm inventory system is also capable of handling the errors and exception handling for tank level reading,product temperature reading and product density reading.Besides that, it also capable of handling the rising tank levels by generating warnings and alarms when the tank level exceeded the specific amount of maximum allowable tank level.Lastly, The tank farm inventory system also able to communication with senior supervisors on duty by sending notification automatically when the warnings and alarms are being triggered. The automated notification system shall be using SMS, Email, software telegram application and software whatsapp appliation.\\}
			

\subsection{Purpose}
