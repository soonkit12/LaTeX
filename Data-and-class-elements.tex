	\noindent{
		Based on figure 2.2, Subset of the classes in this diagram are the data classes which correspond to entities in the system\\}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Tank : It contains the tank attributes and behaviour.
			\item TankData : It containssome product attributes and behavior which is in the tank.
			\item Pomp : Each tank has pomp and this class consists of pomp attributes and behavior.
			\item Alarm : Each tank has alarm and this class consists of alarm attributes and behavior.
			\item Product : It contains product attributes and behavior.
			\item Staff : It contains staff attributes and behavior.
			\item Report : It contain report attributes and behavior.
			\item Alert : It contains alert attributes and behavior.
		\end{itemize}

		Subset of the classes in this diagram are the class which control the process flow in the system\\}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Login Controller : It use to do some user process like login,logout and registration.
		\item Report Controller : It use to do some report like generating manual report and scheduled report.
		\item AlertController : It use to do some alert process like login,logout and registration.
		\item RegisterController :  It use to do some product and tank registration and process registration.
		\item DataController : It use to do some update process for both manual and scheduled data.
